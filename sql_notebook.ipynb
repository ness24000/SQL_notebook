    "**What is a relational database?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A relational database (RD) is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another (we will shortly see what this 'related to each other' really means). In a relational database, information is stored in tables (notice the plural, as a database may contain one or more tables, usually plenty), where each column is an attribute and each row is a record (i.e. a particular observation). See for example Table 1, where the different pens a shop sells are the entries, and each of them has different attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "TABLE 1: \n",
    "| **product_id** | brand | type |product_name | price |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| **1** | Bic | Pen | Bic Crystal | 1.5 |\n",
    "| **2** | Bic | Pen | Bic Shiny | 2 |\n",
    "| **3** | Montblanc | Fountain Pen |Gentleman | 75 |\n",
    "| **4** | Pilot | Pen | Gel Pen | 3 |\n",
    "| **5** | Thomas | Pen| Gel Pen |2.5|\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Tables in a RD have some important components. Firstly, we find the *primary key*, which is an attribute that uniquely identifies a record (i.e. a row). One may also create a composite *primary key*, in which case it will be a combination of attributes which uniquely identify a record. What is crucial is that every table in a RD must have a *primary key*, which will have unique values and will not be NULL (i.e. NULL is equivalent to NA in pandas). In our example from Table 1, we have an attribute **product_id** which acts as primary key, as it uniquely identifies each record. \n",
    "\n",
    "What makes RD 'relational' is the way different tables in a database are connected. Lets for instance introduce Table 2 into our database, where information about the pen manufacturers is stored. We say that we have two tables, each for a particular *entity* (i.e. the pens sold, and the pen manufacturers). In Table 2 we again observe a primary key, in this case the brand name. We are expressing the relationship between the two tables by linking each pen with its manufacturer, by including the brand attribute in Table 1. When we include the primary key from a another table into our table, we call it a *foreign key*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another important point to notice is that one brand may produce more than one pen, while each pen may only be produced by one brand. This is an example of a 1-to-N relationship, but we may also observe 1-to-1 or N-to-M relationships. This are referred to as the *cardinality of the relationship*. We will later see how to handle N-to-M cardinalities. For the time being, notice that when we observe a 1-to-N cardinality we store the foreign key in the N side of the relationship. In our particular case, we store the brand in the pen table, and not the other way around. \n",

    "- If a table did not have a primary key (i.e. there would be no column with unique non-null values), it is not guaranteed that you can read (i.e. select) all records. If two pens have the same id and the rest of variables are equal you could not differentiate them. And even if the rest of the values were not equal, one would have to look at the different values and see how to index this particular record. All this trouble is avoided by having a primary key. \n",

    "**Entity relationship diagrams**\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality we design RDs with many more entities and more complicated relationships between them. It is then very useful to make use of some sort of diagram which clearly specifies which *entities* constitute our database and how do they relate to each other. This tool is referred to as an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD). The collection of entities and relationships that will form a RD is referred to as the *requirements* of the database. The job when designing a RD is to satisfy these requirements. Lets see complicate our stationary example and use it to introduce ERD. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Requirements for the stationary database:** We have different pens which are manufactured by one brand and sold in one or more shops. A brand manufactures one or more pens, and owns at least one shop.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are required to create a database to store this information. The first natural question is how many entities we have. In this case we have: pens, shops and manufacturers. For each of these entities we will want to store some attributes such as the ones we store in tables 1 and 2. And finally, we will have to relate them in the correct way. All of these can be synthesized in an ERD, such as the one in Figure 1. Lets break it down. \n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "![ERD for the described requirements](diagrams/diagram.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, we see that each entity is represented by a box, where its attributes are shown. We mark in red the primary key and foreign keys are marked green. All of these we have already seen. But in this diagram we are also representing the relationship between the different entities. We do this by connecting them with lines with a 'meaningful' verb describing what the relationship consists of. On top of that we see the cardinality represented next to this verbs. For instance, the relationship we already discussed between pens and brands, a 1-to-N cardinality, is represented by an N on the pens side and a 1 on the brands side. Because a shop may sell many pens and a pen may be sold in many shops, we have an N-to-M relationship. You will notice that there are no foreign keys representing this relation, we will see later why this is and how one represents this sort of relationships in a RD. Finally, some lines are double and some are not. This represents the *participation level*. If all the records of an entity participate in a relationship, the line is double. In the 'brands own shops' relationship this is the case for brands, as they all own at least one shp. It is not the case for shops, though, as the may not be owned by a pen brand. "

    "### 2. What is SQL and how to set it up\n",
    "\n",
    "We have introduced relational databases and introduced its conceptual backbone. But how do we actually implement these ideas computationally? The answer is Structure Query Language (SQL). SQL is a programming language used to create and manage RDs, and it will allow us to incorporate all the ideas we have discussed in the previous section. One particularity of SQL is that there different *dialects*  (e.g. Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL). Although they are all built upon SQL and incorporate the same concepts, the syntax is slightly different. It is not usually possible to use SQL code written for PostgreSQL in Microsoft SQL Server, for example, without making some modifications. For this notebook we will use SQLite, and extremely light-weight and serverless (i.e. runs on your machine and directly acts on the database) version with almost non needed set up procedure. You can find the official documentation for SQLite <a href = 'https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html'> here </a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Installing SQLite**\n",
    "\n",
    "In most modern computers (Windows 10 or higher) SQLite comes pre-installed. To check if this is the case in your computer, open the terminal and run the command `sqlite3`. If you see a response showing the version number among other information, the SQLite is already installed. If the terminal does not recognize the command, then you still need to install it. For this we recommend you follow the steps in <a href = https://sqldocs.org/sqlite/sqlite-installation/#pre-installation-checks>this tutorial</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Setting up a workspace for SQLite**\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with RDs using SQL languages you will mostly encounter two types of file extensions `.db` and `.sql`. The former will be the file where the database is stored. The latter will be the file where SQL code is written. You can think of this as having a `.csv` file with your data and and `.py` file with your Python code that reads and changes the data file. \n",
    "\n",
    "Like we saw with Python, one could write SQLite code directly on the terminal. But because this is quite inconvenient we use an IDE to write and run our code. There are many options for this, but we will try to keep it simple and use VisualStudio together with <a href = 'https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alexcvzz.vscode-sqlite'> this </a> SQLite extension. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have SQLite in your computer and you have downloaded the SQLite extension for Visual Studio, move to the next step. \n"

    "We are first going to use SQLite to create a relational database. To make things more interesting, we will use a new set of requirements for our database, involving the organization of a Language School:\n",
    "\n",
    "*The International Language School provides language training services for corporate clients, offering classes either at their premises or at the School itself. The School employs multiple teachers, each capable of teaching various courses. Clients, in turn, offer courses to their employees, who can enroll in multiple courses. Each course is associated with one client and one teacher, and participants are employees of the client companies, with the possibility of being enrolled in more than one course.*\n",
    "\n",
    "I encourage you to try and create an ERD for yourself based on these requirements. The one we will be using to guide the creating of our database can be seen in Figure 3: \n",

Then create a new file in this directory called `school_database.db`. Now, open the file, right click on it and press 'new query'. An SQL file will open on a new tab, and here is where we will be writing our code. Save this file in the same directory and as `school_create.sql`. \n",

Nevertheless, it is standard practice for readability purposes. Similarly, line changes and indents are irrelevant, but it is standard to include them for readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we will do is create the four tables for the four entities we have in our database. For this is crucial to get familiar with the different data types that SQL supports. There are many but here we will be using $^1$: \n",
    "- INT : an integer number (e.g. 0, 1, 2, 3...)\n",
    "- NULL : a cell with missing data.\n",
    "- TEXT : a string. \n",

    "  address TEXT NOT NULL,\n",
    "  industry TEXT\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We first use the key words `CREATE TABLE` to tell SQL that we want to create a new table. We then, give the name of the table `client` and open brackets to define the columns. For each column we specify the name (e.g. `client_id`) and the data type (e.g `INT`). We use a comma after defining each column and close the brackets when all the columns have been defined. Finally, we finish all SQL code with a `;`. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are some other key words following the data type in each column. This are referred to as *constraints*. With `NOT NULL` we specify that `client_name` and `address` cannot be left empty when imputing a record. We also specify which of our attributes is going to act as `PRIMARY KEY`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we understand the code, lets run it and actually create this table in our `school_database.db`. To do so, copy the code to `school_create.sql`, double click on the file and press `Run query` (you may also use the shortcut Ctrl + Shift + Q). A drop down menu will show, asking you to select the `.db` file you want to run this code on, select `school_database.db`. From now onwards, the code you run on this file will take effect on this database. \n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You have created your first SQL table. To check this you can run the code `.tables` to get a list of the tables in the dataset. To run new code using this file you have two options: comment out the previous piece of code and use `Run query` again (you will get an error if you run code that creates a table which already exists), or select the code you want to run, right click and press `Run Selected Query`. \n",
    "\n",
    "In case you wanted to delete the table (e.g. had you designed it wrong in some way), you can easily do so with the following code: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "DROP TABLE teacher;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Keep in mind that this permanently deletes the table **together with all its records**. So be very careful using this code in the future. \n",

    "\n",
    "**Basic queries**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section we saw how to create a database and 'populate' it with records. We will now see how to access the database so the data contained in it can be analyzed. For this, lets create a new SQLite file in the directory where `school_database.db` is and call it `school_analysis.sql`. We have already seen two queries that allow us to get information from the database, namely `.tables` to see the name of all the tables in the database and `SELECT * FROM table_name` to see all the content in a table. But lets dive deeper. \n",
    "\n",
    "We refer to pieces of SQL code that allow us to access certain data from the database as *queries*. The basic structure of a query is: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT attributes\n",
    "FROM table\n",
    "WHERE condition;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the query `SELECT * FROM table_name` we specify that we want to see all attributes using `*`, and we do not specify any condition, thus all the data is shown. We could also ask for a particular group of attributes: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT client_name, industry\n",
    "FROM client;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> Notice that when writing queries, just like when we were creating the database, if we `Run query` all the code in the file will be ran. You can either comment out or delete previous queries, or use `Run selected query` instead. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Conditions**\n",
    "\n",
    "You will rarely want to get all the data from a column, in most cases you want to filter the data in some way. For this we use conditions after the keyword `WHERE`. Notice that this conditions are also used when creating, manipulating or deleting data (remember how we used conditions when updating and deleting records in the previous section). Thus, all you are about to learn about conditions also apply to these situations. \n",

    "Here only records where the attribute `language` is equal to `ENG` will be displayed. Notice that we also ordered the result by `level`. By default SQLite orders in a descending fashion, you can change this using the keyword `ORDER BY attribute DESC`. You can also apply ordering by multiple attributes, where the hierarchy of the order will follow the order of the attributes. Try for instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT * \n",

Nevertheless, the real strength of these approaches becomes clear when we start joining tables that are related, to obtain the information we want. A *join* means combining two tables based on a column they have in common. For instance, we can relate the `teacher` table to the `course` table, and obtain more information on the courses each teacher tutors, by means of the columns `teacher_id` in `teacher` and `teacher` in `course`. This is the main role of foreign keys. \n",

The answer is simple, we first join one of the tables to the *relationship table* (i.e. `takes_course` in our case), and then we join again to the other table. For instance, if we want to get the names of all participants who are taking a course of level B2, we would use a query like this: \n",

But if this is not the case, we want to specify what happens to the rows that do not find a match. That is where *outer joins* come in handy. There are two types. First, there is the *left join*, which keeps all the rows in the left table, and matches the corresponding rows from the right.

In the example, we are doing a simple query that should return the name of the teacher with id 1. We are storing this output in the variable `result`. We can now use `.fetchone()` to obtain one row of output, `.fetchmany(n)` to obtain `n` rows of output or `.fetchall()` to obtain all of the output. In our particular case this is not relevant as our query will return a single row. \n",
    "\n",
    "We use `cursor.execute()` to run any type of SQLite code (All we have learned works here as well!). This includes code that modifies the database, such as the `UPDATE` statement that follows in our example. Notice that we are not saving the output into any variable, because this query returns no output. The changes these queries make are not automatically saved on the database. If one closes the connection or opens the queries the database from another program, he will not see that we changed the name of the first teacher. In order to permanently write the changes into the database we use `connection.commit()`. Finally, when one is done working with the database, the connection should be closed. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Further sqlite3 elements**\n",
    "\n",
    "Often we will want to use Python variables in our SQLite code. To do so we use *placeholders*. The first approach is to use question marks: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "result = cursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM client WHERE client_id = ?\", (101,))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we put question marks in the elements of the query we want to take on Python variable values, and introduce a tuple with those Python variables as the second argument of the `execute` method. The tuple should contain the variables in the order they should replace question marks in the query. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach is to use named placeholders: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "result = cursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM client WHERE client_id = :id\", {'id':1})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we use names preceded by a `:` in the query, and define them using a dictionary as the second argument of the `execute` method. Both methods are correct and work equally well. A third method that should be avoided is using string formatting, such as f-string, as they are very insecure when used in actual applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can use placeholders and the method `.executemany()` to run many similar queries in one go. If, for example, we want to insert four different new records into the `teacher` table:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "data = [(7,'Tomas', 'Smith', 'MAN', None, '1990-11-12', 34650, '+447840921326'), (8, 'Maria', 'Johnson', 'ENG', None, '1985-09-25', 42000, '+447840921327'), (9, 'John', 'Doe', 'MAN', 'ENG', '1978-03-15', 50000, '+447840921328'), (10, 'Emily', 'Williams', 'ESP', None, '1995-07-08', 38000, '+447840921329')]\n",
    "\n",
    "cursor.executemany(\"INSERT INTO teacher VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)\", data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, instead of passing one single tuple with the values to substitute in the placeholders of the query, we pass a list of tuples, one for each new record we want to create. It is important to note that `.executemany()` only works with queries that modify the database and will not work with queries that look up information (e.g. a `SELECT` statement)$^1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$^1$  In particular, it only works with DML statements. You can learn more about what these are and how one classifies SQL statements <a href = 'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-ddl-dql-dml-dcl-tcl-commands/#dcl-data-control-language'> here </a>."

    "In this exercise you are given the requirements for a database as well as some data in `.csv` format, and you will have to design and populate an SQL database. For this you will need to make use of what we have learned about RDs, SQLite and sqlite3 in Python. This is good practice for your *DE individual assignment*, where you will also need to design and population your own RD. \n",
    " \n",
    "> **Database requirements**: Musify is a music streaming service. Their servers contain many tracks users can listen to. Each of the tracks belongs to an album, which in turn belongs to one artist (there are no artists collaborations). Artists may, nevertheless, have multiple albums. Musify has created playlists to put together similar songs (e.g. classic songs, TV show songs). This playlists contain multiple tracks and tracks may be present in multiple playlists. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Data**: You can find the provided data in the `exercise_data` folder that comes with this notebook. There are four `.csv` files.  \n",
    "\n",
    "From this information and these data, you should create a database called `musify_database.db`. This should be a RD which correctly implements the database requirements, and where tables are populated with the data provided in the `.csv` files. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints and important steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The best approach to solving this problem involves four steps. First, draw the ERM corresponding to this RD. What entities do we have, what are their relationship, what attributes do they have, which are foreign keys...? Secondly, read the data into Python using Pandas. You should clean it and modify so you have a DataFrame for each table you want to create. Third, create the database and its tables, following the design you have already layed out in your ERD. This step can be done using SQLite directory or within Python using sqlite3. Finally, you should populate the tables you have created. This step must be done in Python using sqlite3, and you can go about it in different ways. The tools needed are provided in section 5, but you should make use of your previous knowledge of Python (e.g. for loops, functions).\n",
    "- When data is transferred from Python to a database, `sqlite3` attempts to do appropriate conversions (e.g. `int` $\\rightarrow $ `INT`, `None` $\\rightarrow$ `NULL`). Nevertheless, there are many different data types in Python (e.g. `numpy.int64`) that `sqlite3` cannot handle properly. A solution to this is to pass all the data as `strings`, because SQLite handles numbers and text in the same way. You should be careful though that `NaN` values are translated as `NULL`.\n",
    "- As you have, hopefully, noticed from the requirements text, playlists and tracks have an N-to-M relationship. As we have seen, in SQL this sort of relationships are handled by means of a third table where each row is a 'link' between records. Note that we are missing this table at the moment, and we only have a column in `playlists` containing the tracks that are included in the playlist. From this, you should be able to arrange the data in such a way that the *connection* table can be populated.\n",
