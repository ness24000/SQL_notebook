Directory and files explanation: 

- sql_notebook.ipynb: This is the main file containing the theory on relational databases, SQLite and sqlite3. It also contains exercises and the answer to the exercises. 
	
- exercise_data: Here there are four csv files which are used in the final exercise from the sql_notebook. They contain data that students should be able to incorporate in a relational database of their design. 

- database_and_code_theory: This directory contains a school_database.db which is the database students should be able to create from the indications in the theory part of the notebook. It also contains school_create.sql, which is the SQLite code needed to create school_database.db. It also contains school_analysis.sql, which includes the SQLite code given to students in the theory part regarding queries and data analysis in SQLite. It also contains school_analysis.py, which includes the code given to students in the theory part about sqlite3
	
- database_and_code_exercise: Contains musify_database.db, the database students should be able to create in the exercise. It also contains, answer_exercise.py, the code used to create exercise.db and thus the answer to the exercise. 
	
- diagrams: multimedia files used in sql_notebook.ipynb.
